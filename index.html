 <h1>C Programming</h1>
 <p>
 C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie as a system programming language to write operating systems. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style. These features make C language suitable for system programming like operating systems or compiler development.

 <h1>Java</h1>
 <p>
 Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years. Java is Object Oriented. However, it is not considered a pure object-oriented language as it provides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc). The Java code is first compiled into bytecode (machine-independent code). Then the bytecode is run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.
